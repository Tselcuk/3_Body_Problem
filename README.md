The 3 Body Problem is an infamous chaotic system in physics. 
A small change in the inital conditions creates vastly different simulations. 
I encourage you to fork the files and simulate your own chaotic system!
Here are some things to consider: 
  - dt: This variable controls the time step, the smaller it is the more accurate your simulation will be. If the simulation is wildly slow, lowering this variable would be a good idea.
  - Vo: The inital velocity matrix, changing this can have some cool implications.
  - P: Position Matrix, change where the planets start.
  - G: Gravitational constant, will change the force values and in turn acceleration.
  - m1, m2, m3: Mass of the planets, you can make them negative, its pretty cool.
Enjoy!!
